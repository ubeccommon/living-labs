## 📋 What This Does

When integrated, this service will:

✅ **Detect** when a steward doesn't have a Stellar wallet  
✅ **Generate** a secure Stellar keypair for them  
✅ **Fund** the account with 5+ XLM automatically  
✅ **Add** UBECrc trustline for receiving rewards  
✅ **Educate** users about wallet security  
✅ **Provide** credential download option  
✅ **Auto-fill** public key in registration form  

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Required

You'll need to set these environment variables:

```bash
STELLAR_FUNDING_PUBLIC=G...     # Your funding account
STELLAR_FUNDING_SECRET=S...     # Funding account secret
STELLAR_ONBOARDING_ENABLED=true
STELLAR_MIN_FUNDING_AMOUNT=5.0
```

**Important**: Your funding account needs at least 100 XLM to create ~18 wallets.

✅ **Principle #3**: Service registry for dependencies  
✅ **Principle #4**: Database as single source of truth  
✅ **Principle #5**: Strict async operations  
✅ **Principle #9**: Integrated rate limiting  
✅ **Principle #10**: Clear separation of concerns  
✅ **Principle #12**: Method singularity (no duplication)
