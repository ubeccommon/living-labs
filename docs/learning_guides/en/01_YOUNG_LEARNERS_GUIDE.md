## 🌳 Your Living Garden

### What Makes a Garden "Living"?

When we call our garden a "Living Laboratory," we mean something very special. This garden is not like a museum where everything stays the same. It is **alive**!

Every day, something changes. Seeds sprout into tiny green shoots. Flowers open their petals to the sun. Bees buzz from blossom to blossom. Soil becomes softer or harder. Rain falls or sunshine warms the earth.

And the most magical thing? **You** are part of this living garden too! When you visit, when you water plants, when you simply sit quietly and watch—you become part of the garden's story.

### Your Special Role

In our Living Laboratory, you are not just a visitor. You are a **Guardian** who helps protect and care for plants and creatures. You are an **Observer** who notices changes and patterns. You are a **Student** who learns from nature itself. And you are a **Teacher** who can share what you discover with others.

---

## 👀 The Five Senses Adventure

Before we use any special tools or machines, we need to wake up our most important tools—**your five senses**! Nature gave you amazing ways to explore the world. Let's practice using them in the garden.

### 👁️ Seeing Like a Scientist

**Activity: The Really Close Look**

Choose one plant in the garden. Now, look at it in four different ways.

First, stand back and look at the whole plant. What shape is it? How tall? What colors do you see? Next, get closer. Can you see the veins in the leaves? Are there tiny hairs on the stem? Then lie on the ground and look up at the plant from below. What do you notice from this angle? Finally, if you have a magnifying glass, use it to look very, very closely. What tiny details can you discover?

When you look at your plant, notice the colors. How many different shades of green can you find? Notice the shapes. Are the leaves round? Pointy? Wavy? Look for patterns. Do you see lines, dots, or spirals? Watch for movement. Is anything swaying in the wind? Are insects visiting?

After you finish looking, draw what you see in your journal. Don't worry about making it perfect—just draw what you notice!

---

### 👂 Listening to the Garden

**Activity: The Silent Minute**

Find a comfortable spot in the garden where you can sit or stand very still. Close your eyes if you feel safe doing so. For one whole minute, just listen.

What can you hear? You might hear birds singing or calling to each other. You might hear wind rustling through leaves. Listen for insects buzzing or chirping. Can you hear water flowing or dripping? Notice the sound of your own breathing. Maybe you can even hear the very quiet sound of plants growing! After your silent minute, open your eyes. Which sound was the loudest? Which was the softest? Were there any sounds that surprised you?

Try this experiment. Come back to the same spot at different times of day—morning, midday, and evening. Do you hear different sounds at different times?

---

### 👃 Smelling the Garden's Secrets

Plants use smells to talk to insects, to protect themselves, and sometimes just to say "hello" to the world!

**Activity: The Smell Walk**

Walk slowly through the garden and gently touch or smell different plants. **Always ask your teacher first** before touching or smelling any plant—some plants don't like to be touched, and we must respect them!

You might discover smells that are fresh and green, like grass after rain. Some smells are sweet and lovely, like flowers attracting bees. Other smells are sharp and strong, like herbs that protect themselves. And some smells are earthy and rich, like soil after rain.

Here is a smell challenge for you. Can you find something that smells like dinner? Something that smells like sunshine? Something that smells like nothing at all?

---

### 🖐️ Touching with Care

Our sense of touch can tell us so much! But remember—we always touch plants **gently** and with **respect**. They are living things, just like us.

**Activity: The Texture Hunt**

In the garden, can you find something that feels smooth (like a polished stone or certain leaves)? Find something rough (like tree bark or a bumpy seed pod). Look for something soft (like moss or furry leaves). Be careful with anything prickly (like a thistle or pine needles). Feel something wet (like morning dew on grass). Find something warm (like soil in the sunshine) and something cool (like shaded soil or a smooth stone).

Draw or write about the different textures in your touching journal. Which was your favorite to touch? Which surprised you the most?

---

### 👅 Tasting the Garden (Safely!)

**Important Safety Rule**: We **NEVER** taste anything in the garden unless a teacher or parent says it is safe. Some plants are delicious, but others can make us sick!

When your teacher says it is okay, you might get to taste fresh herbs like basil, mint, or parsley. You might try ripe berries grown in the garden. Perhaps you will taste vegetables like tomatoes, carrots, or peas. You might even taste edible flowers (yes, some flowers are food!)

**Activity: The Taste Test**

When you have permission to taste something from the garden, follow these steps. First, look at it. What does it look like? Next, smell it. What does it smell like? Then take a tiny taste. Put just a little bit in your mouth. Notice everything. Is it sweet? Sour? Bitter? Salty? Spicy? Finally, say thank you. Remember to thank the plant for sharing its gift!

---

## 🐛 Meeting the Garden Helpers

Our garden is full of helpers—creatures big and small who make the garden healthy and strong. Let's meet them!

### 🐝 The Pollinators

**Bees, Butterflies, and Friends**

These amazing helpers fly from flower to flower, carrying pollen (a yellow powder) that helps plants make seeds and fruits.

What do pollinators do? They visit flowers to drink sweet nectar. They accidentally carry pollen from plant to plant. They help new fruits and vegetables grow. They make the garden more colorful and busy!

How can you help them? Plant flowers they love (ask your teacher which ones!). Never harm or chase them. Leave small puddles of water for them to drink. Watch them quietly and learn their favorite flowers.

**Activity: Pollinator Watch**

Sit near some flowers for 10 minutes. Count how many different pollinators you see. Can you tell the difference between honeybees (fuzzy and golden), bumblebees (big, round, and fluffy), butterflies (colorful wings that flutter), and hoverflies (look like bees but are actually flies)?

---

### 🪱 The Soil Builders

**Worms, Beetles, and Tiny Creatures**

Under your feet, there is a whole world you can't see very well! Millions of tiny creatures live in the soil, making it healthy and rich.

Meet the earthworm. Earthworms are like the gardeners of the underground world. They dig tiny tunnels that let air and water reach plant roots. They eat old leaves and turn them into rich, black soil. They help make the garden healthy without us even seeing them!

**Activity: Worm Search**

On a day after rain, look carefully at the soil. Can you find earthworms wriggling through the dirt? Look for little holes in the ground where worms live. Search for worm castings (yes, that's worm poop—and it's like gold for plants!)

Be gentle. If you pick up a worm, hold it carefully in your hand for just a moment, then place it back in the soil. Worms need to stay moist and safe.

---

### 🐦 The Seed Spreaders

**Birds and Small Animals**

Birds don't just sing beautiful songs—they also help the garden grow! They eat berries and seeds, then poop them out far away (which plants new gardens!). They eat harmful insects that might hurt plants. They build nests using things from the garden. They show us that the garden is healthy by choosing to live here.

**Activity: Bird Watching**

Make a simple bird watching spot. Sit very quietly near a tree or bush. Watch for 15 minutes without making noise. Notice what colors the birds are, how they move, and what sounds they make. Draw the birds you see in your journal.

---

## 🤖 What Are Sensors?

Now we come to something very special! In our Living Laboratory, we have helpers that are not alive—but they can still "feel" things about the garden. We call them **sensors**.

### Sensors Are Like Super Senses

Remember how you used your five senses to explore the garden? Sensors are like special tools that can feel things that we cannot feel ourselves.

Think about it. You can feel if the air is warm or cold, but can you feel **exactly** how warm? You can see if soil looks wet or dry, but can you tell **exactly** how wet? You know when it's sunny, but do you know **exactly** how much sunshine?

Sensors can! They are like having **super powers** for measuring things in nature.

### What Do Our Sensors Feel?

In the Erdpuls Müllrose Living Laboratory, we have special sensors that can feel many different things.

Our **temperature sensor** feels how warm or cold the air is. It tells us the temperature in degrees (like when you have a fever thermometer, but for the garden!). It helps us know if plants are too hot or too cold.

Our **humidity sensor** feels how much water is floating in the air. Even when you can't see it, there is always some water in the air! Plants need the right amount—not too dry, not too wet.

Our **soil moisture sensor** goes deep into the ground to feel if the soil is thirsty. It helps us know when to water plants and makes sure roots have enough water to drink.

Our **soil temperature sensor** feels how warm or cold the soil is deep underground. Plant roots like it when the soil is just the right temperature. Too cold and seeds won't sprout. Too hot and roots get stressed!

Our **light sensor** measures how bright the sunshine is. Plants use light to make their food (this is called photosynthesis!). This sensor helps us know if plants are getting enough sun.

Our **UV sensor** measures a special kind of light we can't see with our eyes. UV light is very strong and can even give us sunburns! Plants need some UV light but not too much.

Our **air pressure sensor** feels how heavy the air is (yes, air has weight!). It can help predict if it will rain or be sunny. Changes in air pressure mean the weather is changing.

### How Do Sensors Work?

Imagine you are touching a warm rock. Your fingers have special nerves that send a message to your brain saying "This rock is warm!"

Sensors work in a similar way. First, they **feel** something in the garden (temperature, moisture, light). Then they **turn** that feeling into numbers. Next, they **send** those numbers to a computer. Finally, the computer **remembers** what happened so we can look at it later.

### Why Do We Need Sensors?

Here are good reasons why we need sensors.

First, they never sleep. Sensors measure things day and night, even when we're not at school. Second, they remember everything. They keep track of what happened yesterday, last week, even last month! Third, they're very exact. They can tell us the temperature is exactly 22.5 degrees, not just "pretty warm." Fourth, they notice patterns. By measuring all the time, they help us see patterns we might miss. Finally, they help plants. By knowing exactly what plants need, we can take better care of them.

---

## 📊 The Magic of Measurements

Numbers might seem boring, but in the garden, they tell amazing stories!

### Understanding Measurements

Let's learn what those sensor numbers mean.

Temperature is measured in **degrees Celsius** (°C). At 0°C, water freezes and ice forms. At 20°C, we have the perfect temperature for people and many plants. At 30°C, it's getting hot and plants might get thirsty. At 40°C, it's very hot and both people and plants need extra care.

**Activity: Temperature Treasure Hunt**

On a sunny day, use a thermometer (or the back of your hand) to find the warmest spot in the garden. Where is it? Maybe a sunny patch? Now find the coolest spot in the garden. Perhaps in deep shade? How much difference is there between them?

Humidity is measured as a **percentage** (%). At 30%, the air is very dry, like a desert. At 60%, it's just right and comfortable. At 90%, it's very humid, like a rainforest.

How can you feel humidity? On a humid day, the air feels thick and heavy. On a dry day, it feels light and crisp.

---

### Watching Numbers Change

Here's the really magical part: numbers in the garden **change all the time**!

Every day follows a pattern. In the morning, it's cool and often humid, with plants covered in dew. At midday, it's warm and drier, with bright sunshine. In the evening, it cools down and shadows grow long. At night, it's cool, calm, and quiet.

**Activity: The Daily Number Story**

Pick one measurement (like temperature). Check it three times. Check it when you arrive at school (morning). Check it at lunch time (midday). Check it before you go home (afternoon).

Write down the numbers and draw how the garden looks each time. What story do the numbers tell? How does the garden change?

---

### The Meaning Behind the Numbers

Let's pretend our sensors tell us the soil moisture is 25 percent.

What does that mean? It means the soil is pretty dry. It means plant roots might be getting thirsty. It's probably a good day to water. We should check again tomorrow to see if watering helped!

**Activity: Be a Plant Detective**

When sensors show us numbers, we can ask questions. Why is the temperature higher today than yesterday? Why is the soil drier in the sunny part of the garden? What happens to plants when it doesn't rain for many days?

Asking questions makes you a real scientist!

---

## 🌈 Seasons in the Garden

Our Living Laboratory changes with the seasons. Each season has its own magic, its own lessons to teach.

### 🌸 Spring: The Season of Awakening

**What's Happening**

Seeds that slept all winter wake up and sprout. Days get longer and warmer. Birds build nests. Everything turns green!

**What the Sensors Tell Us**

The sensors show us that temperature is rising day by day. There are more sunlight hours. The soil is warming up from winter's cold. Rain showers bring moisture.

**Your Spring Activities**

In spring, you can plant seeds and watch them grow. Look for the first green shoots poking through soil. Listen for birds singing their spring songs. Measure how fast the temperature rises. Count how many different shades of green you can find.

Here's a spring observation challenge. Find something new growing every day for one week. Draw or photograph it!

---

### ☀️ Summer: The Season of Growth

**What's Happening**

Plants grow taller and stronger. Flowers bloom in bright colors. Bees and butterflies are very busy. Everything is alive and active!

**What the Sensors Tell Us**

The sensors show the warmest temperatures of the year. We see the longest days (most hours of sunshine). Soil can get dry and needs watering. Humidity changes with morning dew and afternoon heat.

**Your Summer Activities**

In summer, you can water plants when soil is dry. Watch pollinators visiting flowers. Measure the shadow of a sunflower as it grows taller. Keep track of the hottest day. Make observations about which plants need the most water.

Here's a summer mystery for you. Why do plants droop on very hot afternoons but stand up straight again in the evening? (Hint: Think about water!)

---

### 🍂 Autumn: The Season of Harvest

**What's Happening**

Leaves change to beautiful colors—red, orange, yellow, brown. Days get shorter and cooler. Plants make seeds for next year. Animals prepare for winter.

**What the Sensors Tell Us**

The sensors show that temperature is slowly falling. There are fewer hours of sunlight each day. Soil is starting to cool down. More rain comes as autumn storms arrive.

**Your Autumn Activities**

In autumn, you can collect different colored leaves. Find seeds and seed pods. Watch leaves fall and create a soft blanket on the ground. Measure how quickly the days get shorter. Help plants prepare for winter by adding mulch.

Here's an autumn question. Where do all the leaves go? What happens to them over winter? (We'll discover the answer in the soil!)

---

### ❄️ Winter: The Season of Rest

**What's Happening**

Most plants are sleeping (dormant). The garden looks brown and quiet, but it's resting, not dead! Under the soil, roots are safe and waiting. Some brave plants stay green even in cold weather.

**What the Sensors Tell Us**

The sensors show the coldest temperatures of the year. We see the shortest days (least sunlight). Soil is cold, sometimes frozen. Morning frost appears when air pressure drops.

**Your Winter Activities**

In winter, you can look for signs of life (winter birds, green moss, hibernating insects). Track where frost forms first and melts last. Notice which plants stay green. Check the sensors—are any numbers at zero? Plan what you'll plant when spring returns.

Here's a winter wonder. Plants look "dead" but they're really just sleeping. How do they know when to wake up? (The sensors help us understand this too!)

---

## 📔 Your Observation Journal

A real scientist keeps notes! Your observation journal is where you record all your discoveries.

### What to Include in Your Journal

**Date and Weather**

Write down what day it is. Note whether it's sunny, cloudy, rainy, windy, or snowy. Describe how the weather feels.

**What You See**

Draw pictures of plants, insects, or anything interesting. Describe colors, shapes, and sizes. Note anything that changed since last time.

**What You Measure**

Write down sensor numbers you see. Record your own measurements (like how tall a plant is). Compare today's numbers to yesterday's.

**What You Wonder**

Write questions that pop into your head. Note things that surprise or confuse you. Record ideas about why things happen.

**Your Feelings**

Describe how you feel in the garden. Write what makes you happy or curious. Note what you want to learn next.

---

### Special Journal Pages

**My Favorite Spot**: Draw and describe your favorite place in the garden. Why is it special?

**The Plant I'm Watching**: Choose one plant to observe all year. Draw it every month. How does it change?

**Garden Friends**: Draw the creatures you see. Make a collection of all the different insects, birds, and other animals.

**Weather Detective**: Keep track of the weather for one whole week. Can you see patterns?

**Questions I'm Asking**: Write down every question you think of. Scientists are full of questions!

---

## 🎨 Special Garden Projects

Here are some fun projects you can do throughout the year!

### Project 1: Seed to Flower Journey

**You Will Need**

You need some seeds (beans work great!), soil in small pots, water, sunlight, and your observation journal.

**What to Do**

First, plant your seeds following the instructions on the packet. Give them water and sunlight. Every day, check on them and write what you see. Measure how tall they get. Draw them at different stages.

**Questions to Explore**

How many days until you see the first green sprout? Do all the seeds sprout at the same time? What happens if you forget to water for one day? What happens if one plant gets more sunlight than another?

---

### Project 2: Temperature Treasure Map

**You Will Need**

You need paper and colored pencils, a thermometer (or your hand!), and the garden.

**What to Do**

Draw a simple map of your garden. Find 5-10 different spots in the garden. Measure or feel the temperature in each spot. Use colors to show which spots are warm (red/orange) and which are cool (blue/green).

**Discover**

Why are some spots warmer than others? Do plants growing in warm spots look different from plants in cool spots? Where would you want to sit on a hot day? On a cold day?

---

### Project 3: Rain Gauge Garden Helper

**You Will Need**

You need a clear plastic jar or bottle, a ruler, a permanent marker, and your journal.

**What to Do**

Ask your teacher to help you mark measurements on your jar (every centimeter). Place the jar in an open spot where rain can fall into it. After each rain, measure how much water collected. Write it down and empty the jar for next time.

**Discover**

How much does it rain in one week? One month? Do the plants look happier after more rain? What happens to the soil moisture numbers after it rains?

---

### Project 4: Sun Shadow Clock

**You Will Need**

You need a stick or pole that stays in one place, chalk or stones to mark spots, and a sunny day.

**What to Do**

Push your stick into the ground in a sunny spot. Every hour, mark where the shadow falls. Watch how the shadow moves throughout the day. Notice how the shadow is longest in morning and evening, and shortest at midday.

**Discover**

Why does the shadow move? Why is it longer at some times than others? How does this help plants know what time it is?

---

## 🎁 Thank You Notes from Nature

Remember those sensors we talked about? Every time they collect information about the garden, something very special happens—they earn **thank you notes**!

These thank you notes are called **UBECrc tokens** (you can say "you-beck" tokens). They are like special digital stickers that say "Thank you for helping us understand the garden better!"

### What Are Tokens?

Imagine you helped your teacher clean up the classroom. Your teacher might give you a star sticker to say "Thank you!" The star shows that your help was important and valuable.

UBECrc tokens work the same way. When sensors collect good information about the garden, they earn tokens. These tokens are stored on something called a "blockchain" (like a special digital notebook that never loses pages). The tokens show that taking care of the garden and gathering information is valuable work. One day, these tokens might even be traded for other things, like books or tools for the garden!

### Why Do We Give Thank You Notes?

Because caring for nature is important work! When you water plants when they're thirsty, observe and write in your journal, help keep the garden healthy, or collect information that helps plants grow, you are doing something valuable. The thank you notes (tokens) are a way of recognizing this important work.

### The Gift Economy

In our garden, we practice something called the "**gift economy**." This means the garden gives us food, beauty, fresh air, and places to play. We give the garden our care, attention, and help. Nobody is "paying" anybody—we're all giving gifts to each other! The tokens help us remember and celebrate these gifts.

It's like when you draw a picture for your grandmother, and she bakes cookies for you. Neither of you is "paying" the other—you're giving each other gifts because you care about each other. Our garden works the same way!

---

## 🎉 Celebrations and Rituals

In our Living Laboratory, we celebrate the rhythms of nature throughout the year.

### Morning Garden Greeting

Start each garden visit by saying hello:

*"Good morning, Garden!*  
*Thank you for growing.*  
*Thank you for teaching.*  
*Thank you for being alive.*  
*We will care for you today."*

Then stand quietly for a moment and just breathe. Notice how it feels to be in the garden.

---

### Planting Ceremony

When we plant new seeds, we can make it special. Hold the seeds in your hand and think about what they will become. Prepare the soil gently, making a cozy bed for the seeds. Place each seed carefully, like tucking a baby into bed. Cover with soil and pat it gently. Give water and say "Welcome, little seed. Grow strong!"

---

### Harvest Celebration

When we pick vegetables or fruits, we follow special steps. Say thank you to the plant that grew the food. Handle it gently—this was alive and is now sharing itself with us. Share with others—food tastes better when we share! Save seeds for planting next year.

---

### Seasonal Celebrations

**Spring Awakening**: Celebrate the first green shoots  
**Summer Abundance**: Celebrate the longest day of the year  
**Autumn Gratitude**: Celebrate the harvest and falling leaves  
**Winter Rest**: Celebrate the quiet garden and plan for spring

---

## 👨‍🏫 A Note to Grown-Ups (Parents and Teachers)

This guide is designed to spark wonder and curiosity in young learners. The goal is not to turn children into "mini-scientists" but to help them develop a loving, respectful relationship with the natural world.

Tips for success include letting children explore at their own pace, valuing their observations even when "incorrect," following their questions and interests, modeling wonder and curiosity yourself, celebrating the process of discovery rather than just correct answers, spending time in silence to allow space for direct experience, and trusting that understanding develops over time.

The sensors and technology should enhance, not replace, direct sensory experience. Children this age learn best through their bodies and senses, not through screens or abstract concepts. Use technology sparingly and always in service of deepening the connection with living nature.

---

## 🌱 Growing Forward

You have reached the end of this guide, but your garden adventure is just beginning! Every day in the Living Laboratory brings new discoveries. Keep exploring, keep wondering, keep caring for your garden.

And remember: The garden is not just teaching you about plants and weather and sensors. The garden is teaching you about **life itself**—how things grow, how everything is connected, and how caring for the earth means caring for yourself and everyone else.

Welcome to the Living Laboratory, dear young explorer. The garden is waiting for you!
